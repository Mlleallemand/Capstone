# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

This repository contains an analysis using parametric statistics (ANOVA, ttests) as well as a Random Forest Classifier in order to assess which offers to send to which customer groups.

The data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

The task was to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.
